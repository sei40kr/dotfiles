      # ===================================================================
      # This file contains the default startup commands for ranger.
      # To change them, it is recommended to create either /etc/ranger/rc.conf
      # (system-wide) or ~/.config/ranger/rc.conf (per user) and add your custom
      # commands there.
      #
      # If you copy this whole file there, you may want to set the environment
      # variable RANGER_LOAD_DEFAULT_RC to FALSE to avoid loading it twice.
      #
      # The purpose of this file is mainly to define keybindings and settings.
      # For running more complex python code, please create a plugin in "plugins/" or
      # a command in "commands.py".
      #
      # Each line is a command that will be run before the user interface
      # is initialized.  As a result, you can not use commands which rely
      # on the UI such as :delete or :mark.
